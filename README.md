# CloudStorageUtils

> **_NOTE:_** Under construction

## Description

This project is primarily for organizing images (/ files) on a cloud storage.  
Use cases could be:
- Listing images (including metadata)
- Sorting images
- Filtering on specific criteria
- Running face / object recognition algorithms (which then could be used for further filter possibilities)

> In the end this is a fun low prio project, mainly for training purposes
